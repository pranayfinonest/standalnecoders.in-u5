          question: "What's the difference between a traditional firewall and a next-generation firewall?",
          answer:
            "Traditional firewalls primarily filter traffic based on ports, protocols, and IP addresses. Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) add capabilities like application awareness, user identity monitoring, integrated intrusion prevention, and threat intelligence to provide more comprehensive protection against modern threats.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do we need both firewall and IDS solutions?",
          answer:
            "Yes, these technologies serve complementary functions. Firewalls control traffic flow and enforce access policies, while IDS monitors network and system activities to detect potential threats that might bypass or penetrate firewall defenses. Together, they provide defense-in-depth protection.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can we implement these solutions without disrupting our network?",
          answer:
            "Our implementation methodology is designed to minimize disruption. We typically deploy solutions in phases, testing thoroughly at each stage. For critical environments, we can implement outside of business hours or use parallel deployment strategies to ensure continuity of operations.",
        },
        {
          question: "How do you handle false positives in IDS solutions?",
          answer:
            "False positives are an inherent challenge with IDS. We address this through careful tuning of detection rules, baseline profiling of normal network behavior, and implementing a review process for alerts. Additionally, we can integrate machine learning capabilities to improve detection accuracy over time.",
        },
        {
          question: "What ongoing maintenance is required?",
          answer:
            "Effective firewall and IDS solutions require regular maintenance including firmware updates, signature updates, rule reviews, log monitoring, and periodic performance tuning. We offer managed services to handle these tasks or can provide training for your internal team.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can these solutions protect against encrypted threats?",
          answer:
            "Modern security solutions can inspect encrypted traffic through SSL/TLS inspection capabilities. This requires careful implementation to balance security needs with privacy considerations and application compatibility. We'll work with you to develop an appropriate strategy for encrypted traffic inspection.",
